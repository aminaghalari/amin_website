bio: My methodological expertise lies in discrete and stochastic optimization,
  data analytics and statistical learning, data-driven decision making, parallel
  computing, and heuristics techniques. I applied these methodologies to solve
  real-life problems in a broad range of application areas, such as logistics
  and supply chain, energy, and security-related problems.
