I received the B.S. and M.S. degrees in industrial and system engineering at Sharif University of Technology, Tehran, Iran, in 2015 and 2018, respectively. I am currently a Ph.D. student in industrial and system engineering at Mississippi State University, USA. My methodological expertise lies in discrete and stochastic optimization, data analytics and statistical learning, data-driven decision making, parallel computing, and heuristics techniques. I applied these methodologies to solve real-life problems in a broad range of application areas, such as logistics and supply chain, energy, and security-related problems.
